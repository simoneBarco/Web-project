# Web-project
University project in order to implement a website of a shop of videogames.
In this group project we used:

* HTML
* CSS
* XML
* Perl
* Javascript

The website uses Perl to visualize, add, modify and remove elements.
These are within XML files and Perl allows to extract them and elaborate in a website.
the code written in HTML and CSS is managed by Perl in order to create a website that pay attention to the accessibility.
